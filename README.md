# PyBer Ridesharing Fares for Rural, Suburban and Urban Analysis


##**Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to use Python and Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type provided through our liason, Omar, at PyBer. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type (Rural, Suburban and Urban). Finally, in this written report I will summarize how the first quarter data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by PyBer to address disparities and prepare for a more profitable future.


#Project Deliverables
 
This analysis consists of two technical deliverables: 
1) A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type that I will refer to as Figure 1

2) A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type that i wil refer to as Figure 2

##**Results of Analysis
 
description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.
The data collected thru the first quarter rideshares of 2019 provided a glimpse into the differences between the three city types illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. in the first column, Total Rides, of Figure 1 it is clear to see that the overwhelming majority of rides take place in the Urban setting, which is also supported by the second column, Total Drivers. Based on the current business structure it can be inferred that more drivers are needed to service more rides in the more densly populated Urban area.  
  
 
**Summary

I will offer three recommendations for addressing disparities among the city types.   
 
#Current trends in Ridesharing


The ridesharing market is divided among three major segments at this time: 1.)Types (Fixed Ridesharing, Dynamic Ridesharing, Corporate Ridesharing), 2.) Service Types (App-based, Web-based, and Web/App Based) and, 3.) Geography (North America, South America, Europe, Asia, etc.)(Credit article: https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/ridesharing-market.)
