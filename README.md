# PyBer Ridesharing Fares for Rural, Suburban and Urban Analysis


##**Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to use Python and Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type provided through our liason, Omar, at PyBer. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type (Rural, Suburban and Urban). Finally, in this written report I will summarize how the first quarter data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by PyBer to address disparities and prepare for a more profitable future.


##**Deliverables for this Analysis
 
This assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables: 
1) A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type,

##**Current Trends in Ridesharing
 
 The ridesharing market is divided among three major segments at this time: 1.)Types (Fixed Ridesharing, Dynamic Ridesharing, Corporate Ridesharing), 2.) Service Types (App-based, Web-based, and Web/App Based) and, 3.) Geography (North America, South America, Europe, Asia, etc.)(Credit article: https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/ridesharing-market.)
